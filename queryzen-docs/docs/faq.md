# Frequently asked questions.

## Can only SQL databases be used?
Even though we focus in SQL databases, virtually any Database system that runs queries and
has a Python driver can be used, e.g. MongoDB, Neo4J.

## Which programming languages can be used with QueryZen?
Any programming language that implements the HTTP protocol can be used (pretty much any). We
develop our own Python package to offer a perfect experience but anyone could make a package in any
language, in fact, please do ðŸ˜Š and let us know.

We might develop new ones in the future.
